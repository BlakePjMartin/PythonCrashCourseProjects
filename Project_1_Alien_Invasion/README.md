# Alien Invasion Project
This repository contains the files for the Alien Invasion project from the Python Crash Course (PCC) book. The final game is rows of aliens that slowly descend on a spaceship trying to survive by shooting bullets to kill the aliens.

The Pygame package is required to run the Alien Invasion game.
